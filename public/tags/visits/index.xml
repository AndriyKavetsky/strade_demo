      <description>South Moravian high school students interested in learning more about the STRaDe research group and biometry visited us as a part of the T-exkurze – a field trip project organised by the JCMM. Martin Drahanský introduced them to the topic of biometry in his informative lecture after which we welcomed the students in our biometric lab. There we gave them the opportunity to explore some of the techniques and technologies used in biometry but also to experience them firsthand.</description>
