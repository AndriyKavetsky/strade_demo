              <h3 style="text-align: center;">Founder and head of the group</h3>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Martin began his research activities in 2000 in a year-long project orientated on fingerprint processing. Furthermore, his MSc. thesis was devoted to the comparison of fingerprints and biometric templates compression. In 2001 he graduated from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science BUT and simultaneously from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering FernUniversität in Hagen, Germany. His Ph.D. thesis was focused on generating cryptographic keys from fingerprints, which he defended in 2005 at the Faculty of Information Technology BUT. In 2009, Martin successfully defended his habilitation – his thesis covered again various topics in the field of fingerprints. In 2017 he was promoted to full professor. Martin worked from 2002 to 2005 at the University of Siegen, Institute of Measurement Technology (Germany) and also collaborated with the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft IGD in Darmstadt (Germany). In 2014, he went on sabbatical to the Tokyo Institute of Technology (Japan) for half a year. In recent years, he has focused on areas related to biometric systems – processing of images and videos, sensoric systems (including embedded systems and robotics) and IT security. Finally, it is worth mentioning his leisure activities – judo, mountain bike, via ferratas, fitness and mineralogy plus entomology.</p>

              <h3 style="text-align: center;">Co-founder of the group 2010 – 2020</h3>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Filip began studying at BUT in 1996. In 2001 he graduated from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science BUT. During his MSc. studies he spent a year in Germany, studying and finishing his diploma thesis at the Fachhochschule Wiesbaden. Then, he started his Ph.D. studies, which he finished in 2004. After that he decided on an academic career and successfully applied for an assistant professor position at BUT. Since the time, Filip was studying for his master’s he has been interested in artificial intelligence. In the field of biometry he started performing research in speech recognition and later, speaker recognition, as well. In 2010 together with Martin, he co-funded the STRaDe research group and obtained a grant aimed at computer vision and later another grant aimed at robotics. These events changed the goals and field of Filip’s research areas from speech to applied artificial intelligence, mainly in the field of computer vision, the results of which are the sAOTS semi-autonomous optical tracking system and the RUDA robot. In December 2020, he decided to terminate the cooperation with STRaDe and left his position.</p>

              <h3 style="text-align: center;">Assistant Professor</h3>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Ondrej joined the group in 2014. While working on his master’s and doctoral thesis he primarily focused on damage simulation of synthetic fingerprints and other theoretical and practical areas related to fingerprints. In 2019 Ondrej got the Ph.D. degree and the next year he was accepted as an assistant professor. His research activities revolve around fingerprints, but besides biometry he&#39;s also interested in simulations and AI.</p>
