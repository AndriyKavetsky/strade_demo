Martin Sakin and Jan Tinka spent a week at a biometry summer school organized by professor Massimo Tistarelli in Alghero in Sardinia, where they attended lectures and took part in discussions on topics ranging from person recognition based on iris to recognition based on gait patterns. The main topic of this yearâ€™s summer school was not only biometry but also application of deep learning methods and other machine learning for biometric purposes. Martin and Jan therefore returned from the school endowed with new knowledge, which will be helpful for their dissertation and research.
