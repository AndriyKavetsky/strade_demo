## Biometrics

Biometry is our main topic and we are very experienced team in this area. We have started with biometry in 2000, when our current leaders Doc. Drahanský and Dr. Orság were working on their diploma thesis aimed at fingerprints and voice recognition. When we established our research group STRaDe in 2004, we increased count of our BSc and MSc students together with count of topics we were dealing with. Later, after Doc. Drahanský's conferment of the associate professor degree, we further broadened range of our research areas especially the biometrical ones. At the beginning it was the fingerprints and voice that directed our progress. Later we left the voice technologies and aimed at other interesting topics like liveness detection (especially fingerprint liveness detection), 3D face recognition, 3D hand recognition, hand and finger veins recognition, spoof detection, fake fingerprints production, and, nowadays, iris and retina recognition. A brand new topic in this area of interest is EEG. We aim at impact of various diseases on the recognition of biometrics (before all of fingerprints and eyes). Part of our research is not only design and implementation of algorithms, but even collection of our own databases for research purposes and design and construction of hardware for biometric systems. In our group we have many experiences with projects, testing of biometric systems (e.g. for Czech National Security Authority). We are even experienced with translation of biometric standards ISO/IEC and comments on working drafts (WD - Working Draft) of biometric standards. 

## Biomedicine

Biomedical applications are very closely related to the biometric systems. We have began dealing with biomedical applications in 2012. In this year we took part in a project ICRC (International Clinical Research Centre) in a BME platform, which was part of the St. Ann's Faculty Hospital . This project finished in 2015, but we liked the ideas we were dealing with so much, that we decided to continue in this field. Part of our biomedical work are, for example: an application for processing and analysis of echocardiograms (speckle tracking), detection and measurement of size of hematoma for Android smartphones and an application for AHEAD database (heart disease records database) processing. The biggest emphasis in STRaDe is put on detection and recognition of skin diseases on fingers and retina diseases. These areas are important for us, since they are part of biometric technologies we are dealing currently with. For our research purposes in these areas we have created our own databases of images of various skin and eye diseases. 

## Robotics 

Our interest in robotics has started in 2005. In this year we started dealing with (intelligent) sensors, which are used in biometrics. Sensory systems are related to the security in IT, too, by connecting wireless sensory systems with biometric authentication. From the sensors it is relatively close to robotics. We have started with robotics in 2009. We developed our own minisumo robots then (mechatronics, hardware, electronics and software). After our success with the minisumo robots we started thinking about something bigger. We decided to construct our own mobile robotic platform big enough to take care of various scenarios. The exact shape, feature set and parameters of the robot were given by our successful application to a grant from the Ministry of Interior of the Czech Republic - Robot for search of human beings in crushes and avalanches. The robotic platform we wanted to design aimed at rescuing people, which sort of forced us to make various decisions about the final design of the platform. The robot can be used to help rescue teams, as it is even able to detect people behind obstacles. We successfully defended the project in 2014 and called the robot RUDA (Robotic Unit for search of human beings in Debris and Avalanches). Since then RUDA has been awarded golden medal for the best exhibits of the 57th International Engineering Fair in Brno. Nowadays, robotics is not our primary area of interest. We are maintaining RUDA, students are working with it, but our limited funds made us stop working further on it. 

## Computer vision

Computer vision is very tightly related to biometric systems, since you need to acquire an image from a camera to get biometric features, in most cases. Even the basic principles of data processing are very similar to the algorithms and techniques of the computer vision. The biggest progress we achieved during our work on projects granted by Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic (Research and development of technologies for intelligent optical surveillance system) and Ministry of Interior of the Czech Republic (Tools and Methods for Video and Image Processing for the Fight against Terrorism), results of which is a number of products. One of the most important product is a surveillance camera system sAOTS with ability to track objects up to 8 km away. sAOTS consists of a camera placed on a military pan/tilt manipulator, which is mounted on a robust stand with a powerful built-in computer system allowing for GPGPU computations. Part of the solution is even a large set of algorithms for object tracking (with a solution for complete and partial occlusions included), image stabilization, detection and recognition of objects (i.e. weapons, faces), anonymization of specified objects, 3D data processing and more. In the field of hardware development for computer vision we can offer experiences with camera system construction and PCB design with a DSP and FPGA for PAL/NTSC or digital FullHD systems, too.
