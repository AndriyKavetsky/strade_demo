<p style="text-align: justify;">The Security Technology Research and Development research group (STRaDe) has been part of the Department of Intelligent Systems at the Faculty of Information Technology of Brno University of Technology since 2010. The main focus of the STRaDe group is research and development in the field of security technologies with an emphasis on both hardware and software aspects. Security technologies involve wide spectra of applications and devices. One huge area we are interested in is biometrics, where we focus on nearly all up-to-date technologies and metrics, for example, the acquisition and recognition of fingerprints, retinas, 3D faces and 3D hands, vein patterns, presentation attack detection of various biometric characteristics, etc.
<br>
The second and no less important part of our research is the area of sensor systems and its application in robotics (generally embedded systems), which is our particular research aim. Research in complex intelligent systems is done in connection with robotics and biometrics. The next part of our research activities is video processing and its implementation in hardware (including acceleration in hardware) for computer vision systems and applications.</p>
