text_content: "Martin began his research activities in 2000 in a year-long project orientated on fingerprint processing. Furthermore, his MSc. thesis was devoted to the comparison of fingerprints and biometric templates compression. In 2001 he graduated from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science BUT and simultaneously from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering FernUniversität in Hagen, Germany. His Ph.D. thesis was focused on generating cryptographic keys from fingerprints, which he defended in 2005 at the Faculty of Information Technology BUT. In 2009, Martin successfully defended his habilitation – his thesis covered again various topics in the field of fingerprints. In 2017 he was promoted to full professor. Martin worked from 2002 to 2005 at the University of Siegen, Institute of Measurement Technology (Germany) and also collaborated with the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft IGD in Darmstadt (Germany). In 2014, he went on sabbatical to the Tokyo Institute of Technology (Japan) for half a year. In recent years, he has focused on areas related to biometric systems – processing of images and videos, sensoric systems (including embedded systems and robotics) and IT security. Finally, it is worth mentioning his leisure activities – judo, mountain bike, via ferratas, fitness and mineralogy plus entomology."
