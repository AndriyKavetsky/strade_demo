Sangeeta has spent the last two years with us here in STRaDe doing research on retinal image processing and has become not only our colleague but also a friend. After this time her stay here finally came to an end and Sangeeta is flying back home, to Bangladesh. She might be leaving permanently, but if everything goes well Sangeeta will return to us once again next year in spring. In the meantime we wish her all the best while we now must get accustomed to her absence from our lab where she had been a constant presence.
